# Morphological-operations
A simple app using Tkinter to perform some image processing 
Absolutely! Here's a comprehensive README text for your project, incorporating clear descriptions, instructions, and usage examples:

**Image and Video Processing App README**

This application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to perform various image and video processing tasks using the OpenCV (cv2) library.

**Features**

* **Image Processing:**
    * Read and display images
    * Apply simple thresholding (multiple types)
    * Apply adaptive thresholding
    * Perform Canny edge detection
    * Perform morphological transformations (dilation, erosion, opening, closing, etc.)
    * Draw shapes (rectangle, circle, line, arrowed line, ellipse, polyline) on images or videos
    * Demonstrate bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
* **Video Processing:**
    * Read and display videos
    * Save processed videos (grayscale conversion)
    * Draw shapes on videos

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (cv2): `pip install opencv-python`
* Tkinter: (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
* Pillow (PIL): `pip install pillow`
* Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
* NumPy: `pip install numpy`

**How to Use**

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Run the `main.py` file:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **The GUI will appear:**
    * Click "Load Image" or "Load Video" to select your file.
    * Use the buttons and dropdown menus to perform the desired processing tasks.
    * For drawing shapes:
        * Select the shape type.
        * Enter the coordinates or dimensions in the provided input boxes.
        * Click "Draw Shapes on Image" or "Draw Shapes on Video".

**Example Usage**

```
# Thresholding
1. Load an image.
2. Click "Apply Threshold" or "Apply Adaptive Threshold."

# Morphological Transformations
1. Load an image.
2. Select the desired operation from the dropdown.
3. Click "Morphological Transformations."

# Drawing Shapes
1. Load an image or video.
2. Select the shape type.
3. Enter coordinates (e.g., "50,50,150,150" for a rectangle).
4. Click "Draw Shapes on Image" or "Draw Shapes on Video."
```

**Important Notes**

* For video processing, ensure the video format is compatible with OpenCV.
* The code includes basic error handling, but it's a good practice to add more robust checks in a production environment.
* The application processes videos frame by frame and does not include any advanced video editing features.
